# Hi, I'm Diego Bravo! 👋🍃

## About Me

I am a passionate 25-year-old software developer who loves exploring the worlds of technology and the arts. When I'm not coding, I enjoy strolling around the city, capturing unique moments through photography, cooking delicious meals, and relaxing with video games. I also play the violin, which is one of my favorite ways to express my creativity.

## Experience

I am currently completing my professional internship at **[Sydicol](https://www.sydicol.com.co/)**, where I have been assigned to Manual Testing and QA, working on exciting and challenging projects. At the same time, I'm developing various personal projects, which you can explore in my GitHub repositories. I hope you find something interesting in my work!
